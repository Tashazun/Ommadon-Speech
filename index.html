    <h1>Fear Rules Men.</h1>
    <h2>By summoning all the dark powers I will infest the spirit of man so that he uses his science and logic to <strong>destroy</strong> himself.</h2>
    <p>What havoc and raze. Turn brother against brother. Greed and averous shall prevail, and those who not hear my words shall pay the price.</p>
    <h4>I'll teach man to use his machines.</h4>
    <h3>I'll show him what distorted science can give birth to.</h3>
    <p>I'll teach him to fly like a fairy, and I'll give the ultimate answer to all his science can ask. And the world will be free for my magic again. While your powers die, mine will flourish. Man will never inherent my domain for I am making man mine. He will understand and come to desire my magic.</p>
    <p>It is inevitable. You shall see.</p>
    <h4>This dark determination I swear by this red crown.</h4>
    <h3>The source of all my dark power.</h3>
    <h2>So be it! Now and forever!</h2>
